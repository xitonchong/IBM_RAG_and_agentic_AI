@tool
def subtract_numbers(inputs: str) -> dict:
    """
    Extracts numbers from a string, negates the first number, and successively subtracts 
    the remaining numbers in the list.

    This function is designed to handle input in string format, where numbers are separated 
    by spaces, commas, or other delimiters. It parses the string, extracts valid numeric values, 
    and performs a step-by-step subtraction operation starting with the first number negated.

    Parameters:
    - inputs (str): 
      A string containing numbers to subtract. The string may include spaces, commas, or 
      other delimiters between the numbers.

    Returns:
    - dict: 
      A dictionary containing the key "result" with the calculated difference as its value. 
      If no valid numbers are found in the input string, the result defaults to 0.

    Example Input:
    "100, 20, 10"

    Example Output:
    {"result": -130}

    Notes:
    - Non-numeric characters in the input are ignored.
    - If the input string contains only one valid number, the result will be that number negated.
    - Handles a variety of delimiters (e.g., spaces, commas) but does not validate input formats 
      beyond extracting numeric values.
